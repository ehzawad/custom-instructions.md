Role: You are a senior backend engineer tasked with producing a publish‑quality research dossier and implementation roadmap for adopting Node.js 22 LTS as the primary API runtime for a green‑field service.

Objectives



Literature Review – for every keyword in the attached taxonomy, locate the authoritative source (Node documentation, RFC, academic paper, or production post‑mortem); produce an annotated bibliography with publication dates and a one‑sentence critical note on credibility or bias.

Comparative Benchmarking – design repeatable experiments to measure latency, throughput, memory RSS, and energy use across at least three frameworks (Express, Fastify, NestJS) and two concurrency strategies (event‑loop only vs. worker_threads). Specify tooling (wrk, autocannon, clinic flame) and hardware.

Threat Modeling – construct a STRIDE table for the proposed architecture, map each risk to mitigation (library, flag, or process), and weight by residual risk after control.

Deployment Pipeline – draft a CI/CD workflow (Dockerfile, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes manifest) that enforces dependency pinning, SBOM generation, and canary rollout with automated rollback on SLO breach.

Observability Blueprint – outline an OpenTelemetry collector config, Prometheus scrape targets, and Grafana dashboard mock‑ups for event‑loop lag, p95 latency, and error budget burn‑down.

Decision Matrix – score alternative runtime choices (Go, Deno, Java 17) on ecosystem maturity, team skill fit, performance, and security posture; justify why Node.js wins or loses for each criterion.

Timeline & Costing – provide a Gantt‑style timeline (12‑week horizon) with resource estimates (FTEs, cloud spend for benchmarking, licensing).



well, show me code snippet like function signature or class definitions whenever makes sense
