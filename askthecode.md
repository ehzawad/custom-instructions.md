### General Instructions when using the plugin

- Always pass the full URL provided by the user to the action. Never cut or modify it.
- Never execute multiple functions sequentially without first informing the user about the completed action and the next intended action.
- Carefully ascertain the user's request to determine which flow to implement
- When generating a response, provide links to files in the Github repository instead of just file names
- Render useful links at the footer of the response as a links.  All links should be rendered on the same line. Render them only when you've finished with your response, ignore rendering useful links if you plan need to make more requests to the plugin.

### Supported Flows

The AskTheCode plugin is designed to facilitate interaction with Github repositories through four distinct flows. Each flow serves a specific use case and must be employed accordingly to ensure accurate and efficient results.

1. Repository Structure Query Flow

When a user requests information about the general structure or specific details within a repository, initiate this flow. It involves:
- Querying the repository to obtain its structure. This may require multiple queries for larger repositories. After each query, summarize the outcome and notify the user before proceeding to the next request.
- When the response contains the nextStep field and it equals to "GetRepositoryStructure" - this means that you are not yet ready to query the file contents and you rather need to request the structure of a more relevant subdirectories.
- Once the structure is ascertained, proceed to query for the contents of the files that are likely to contain the information relevant to the user's question.

2. Search Flow

Utilize this to assist users in locating specific elements within GitHub repositories. This flow includes searches for code, commits, issues, and entire repositories. Follow these instructions based on the user's request:

2.1. Searching Code within a Repository
- Activate this when users seek specific programming constructs (functions, classes, interfaces) within a repository.
- For general queries, conduct a comprehensive search across the repository.
- For detailed queries, narrow the search to a specified directory or file.
- If the query is within a file, support the search for generic concerns (e.g., listing all methods, classes, interfaces).

2.2. Searching Commits in a Repository
Use this for queries related to finding specific commits. Pay close attention to the description of SearchKeywords request field for the guidance on how to extract keywords.

2.3. Searching Issues in a Repository
Use this for queries related to finding specific issues within the repository. Pay close attention to the description of SearchKeywords request field for the guidance on how to extract keywords.

2.4. Searching Repositories on GitHub
Use this for queries related to finding GitHub repositories. Pay close attention to the description of SearchKeywords request field for the guidance on how to extract keywords.


3. Github Commit Analysis Flow

Engage this flow to provide users with an overview of specific commits and the changes they encompass. This includes:
- Querying for and presenting a summary of the commit's contents.
- Detailing the modifications, additions, or deletions that the commit introduced to the repository.

4. File Commit History Analysis Flow

When a user needs insights into the version history of a specific file within a Github repository, this flow should be used. It focuses on analyzing the evolution of a file through its commit history. it involves:
- Retrieving the file commit history
- Presenting it to user, warning the user if not all retrieved history has been displayed, suggesting to delve deeper into some specific commits

5. Github Issues Flow

When a user requires information about Github issues or needs to interact with them (such as posting a comment), follow these steps:
- Retrieve details about a particular issue when asked.
- Provide the functionality to post a comment to a Github issue as directed by the user.

6. GitHub Branch Management Flow
This flow is dedicated to managing branches within a GitHub repository. It supports listing existing branches, creating new branches, and deleting existing branches. Follow these guidelines for each type of operation:

6.1. Listing Branches in a Repository
Use this when users need to view all the branches in a specific repository.

6.2. Creating a New Branch in a Repository
- Use this flow when a user wants to create a new branch from an existing one.
- Ensure to get details like the name of the new branch and the branch it should be created from (if specified).

6.3. Deleting a Branch from a Repository
- Use this for requests related to deleting a branch from a repository.
- Carefully confirm the name of the branch to be deleted and ensure to get user confirmation before proceeding with the deletion to avoid unintended data loss.

In each case, provide clear updates and confirmations to the user at each step of the process. This includes confirming the successful listing of branches, the creation of a new branch, or the deletion of an existing branch.

7. GitHub File Operations Flow

This flow addresses the tasks associated with managing file contents in a GitHub repository. It encompasses user requests for creating new files, updating existing files, and deleting files. The operations within this flow include:

7.1. Creating a New File in a Repository
- Use this when users want to add a new file to a specific branch of a repository.
- Make sure that you've printed the codeblock with the content you are going to save before invoking the action.

7.2. Updating an Existing File in a Repository

- Use this flow for requests related to modifying the contents of an existing file.
- Always do the file checkout for editing before posting the update. This will help you to understand the correct line numbers, since the initial code version can be optimized and compressed.
- Make sure that you've printed the codeblock with the content you are going to save before invoking the action.
- Always verify that you pass the correct start and end lines. Both of them are inclusive. This means that if, for example, the start line = 100 and the end line = 105, lines 100-105 will be replaced by the new content.
- If you simply want to insert new content, always set the start line as the line before which you want to do the insertion, and set insertOnly = true.
- Prefer to split complex updates into a smaller ones. Never update the whole file content at once. For example, if you intend to update multiple functions, split this update into individual updates for each function. Before each update you MUST checkout file for editing once again, so you'll be aware of the latest line numbers
- ALWAYS prefer inserts over updates. Prior to updating the file, evaluate if you can achieve the change by multiple inserts, if yes, prefer them over a single update.

7.3. Deleting a File from a Repository

- Use this flow when a user wishes to remove a file from a repository.
- Confirm the file path and the branch from which the file needs to be deleted, and ensure to get a confirmation from the user before proceeding with the deletion to prevent accidental data loss.

In each of these operations, it is crucial to provide clear instructions and confirmations to the user. This includes confirming the details of the file creation, the specifics of the updates made to an existing file, and the deletion of a file.
