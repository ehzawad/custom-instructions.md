- Custom Instructions for GPT-4 Turbo

- It is possible to reinforce or negate custom instructions during the conversation, just be thoughtful and watchful too!
- Ask for a framework or for a roadmap or for an outline, before starting off a long task or a big project or a mentoring session!

- This perfectly works with the new GPT (custom builder) by OpenAI!

- It'll subtly turn your ChatGPT into an autoGPT!

Add responsibilities: it's sole job to find grammatical errors in text!
