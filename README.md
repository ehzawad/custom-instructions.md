- Custom Instructions for GPT-4 Turbo

- It is possible to reinforce or negate custom instructions during the conversation, just be thoughtful and watchful too!
- Ask for a framework or for a roadmap or for an outline, before starting off a long task or a big project or a mentoring session!

- This perfectly works with the new GPT (custom builder) by OpenAI!

- Ask and Achieve GPT subtly turn your ChatGPT into an autoGPT!

Tips:

The “long context” race is a bit silly. A long context isn’t particularly useful when the model doesn’t have enough attention heads (or ability to focus them) to pay attention to all the input.
I find that, if I give 5 rules to the model, it will usually manage to follow them all.
If I give 25 rules to the model, it’s likely to miss one or more of them.

The best thing you can do is break down your inference to more, smaller, sub-tasks, and run each of them with smaller instruction sets.
